        <p> Alexander Kennedy, the Full Stack Software Developer, built a software that revolutionizes the insurance industry in America. The software gets rid of the need for agents and paying them for policies they sell. By doing so 90% of your policy goes back towards money spent on the discounts, benefits, and a health fund in case of emergencies for you and your family.
